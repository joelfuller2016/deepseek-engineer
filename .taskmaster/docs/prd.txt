# DeepSeek Engineer Unicode Encoding Fix

## Overview
Fix the UnicodeDecodeError that occurs when running deepseek-eng.py due to incorrect .env file encoding.

## Problem Statement
The .env file is currently encoded as UTF-16 LE with BOM, but the python-dotenv library expects UTF-8 encoding. This causes the application to crash on startup with:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte

## Requirements
1. Convert .env file from UTF-16 LE to UTF-8 encoding
2. Preserve all environment variable content
3. Ensure deepseek-eng.py runs without encoding errors
4. Verify the fix is non-breaking

## Technical Details
- Current encoding: UTF-16 LE with BOM (FF FE)
- Required encoding: UTF-8 without BOM
- File location: C:\Users\joelf\deepseek-engineer\.env

## Success Criteria
- deepseek-eng.py runs without UnicodeDecodeError
- All environment variables are preserved and accessible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
